"""deep_robotics_crawl -- a scripted, statically stable crawl for the Deep
Robotics Lite3 / X30 on real contact physics.

WHAT THIS IS, AND IS NOT. This is a scripted foot-space crawl (creep) gait:
one leg swings at a time while the other three stay planted, every foot
target goes through a closed-form 3-DoF leg IK, and the twelve position
servos track the result. The body is NOT pinned or translated by a
supervisor -- the robot moves because its planted feet push on the ground.
Its terrain awareness is a MAP, not perception: when the world has an
ElevationGrid it is read once through the Supervisor (standing in for the
elevation map a real robot builds from depth sensing) and the gait plants
its feet on it, keeps the body at a set height above the mean ground under
the feet, pitches to sustained grades, picks the flattest of three footholds
along the stride, lifts each swing over the highest ground on its path and
slows on descents (TerrainCrawl). A heading hold steers from the robot's own
pose. There is no policy, no contact sensing and no balance feedback (a
measured-tilt loop exists and is OFF: it rocked the robot over). It is not
learned locomotion and must not be reported as such; the learned quadruped
walks in this tree are the Go2 / OmniQuad Shadowing policies
(docs/developer/rl-current-state.md).

The gait model is the Unitree B2 crawl of
projects/policies/control/gait/b2_crawl_gait.py (stance foot slides back at
exactly -vx, swing foot on a quintic catch-up arc, creep order FL -> RR -> FR
-> RL at duty 0.85, stride ramped in from a standing start), re-parameterised
for the Deep Robotics leg geometry and joint conventions. Deep Robotics URDFs
put the hip-roll axis on (-1,0,0) and the hip-pitch / knee axes on (0,-1,0),
the mirror of Unitree's (1,0,0) / (0,1,0), so every IK angle is negated on
the way to the motor. `python deep_robotics_crawl.py --selftest` checks that
mapping by running the IK output through a forward kinematics built from the
URDF chain (no simulator needed).

Robot selection: controllerArgs ["--robot" "lite3"|"x30"]. Speed and cadence
can be overridden with --vx / --freq (m/s, Hz).

Trace (for validation): OMNISIM_PROBE_OUT=<file> writes one line per step
with the body position, up-vector, gait phase and joint angles for
OMNISIM_PROBE_STEPS steps (default 5000); needs `supervisor TRUE`.
