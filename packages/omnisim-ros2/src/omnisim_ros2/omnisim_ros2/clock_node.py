"""Publish OmniSim's simulation clock on ``/clock`` (Tier 2).

Everything else in a ROS 2 stack that cares about simulated time depends on this:
with ``use_sim_time:=true``, every other node's ``get_clock().now()`` follows what
is published here.

Source, in order of preference:

1. With ``use_bridge_clock`` (the bring-up sets it whenever the bridge nodes run):
   the robot bridge's ``POST /get_robot_state`` -> ``sim_time``, the robot
   controller's own clock, refreshed every control step. It is the clock the
   bridge's sensor stamps are in, and it is FINE-GRAINED.
2. Otherwise ``GET /sim/state`` -> ``engine_time_ms``: the same engine clock, but
   sampled only when the harness's injected supervisor steps. Measured 2026-10-02
   on the Husky under ``--engine-mode realtime``: 11 distinct values in 30 wall
   seconds, ~4 s jumps every ~6 s, so ``use_sim_time:=true`` timers fired about
   once per jump. Right ruler, coarse sampling -- fine for "what time is it",
   not for driving 5 Hz timers.
3. An older harness without ``engine_time_ms``: ``sim_time_ms``, the supervisor's
   loop counter, with a warning. Until 2026-10-02 this was the only source, and it
   is a different ruler: it advanced 23 s while the engine advanced 281 s, which
   throttled every sim-time node to ~0.1 Hz (``conversions.simulated_time_ms``).

The harness names the reason when it has no reading, in ``sim_time_source``; this
node branches on that rather than trusting a number that may be stale.

⚠ THIS NODE MUST NOT USE SIM TIME ITSELF. It is the publisher of record, so
``use_sim_time`` is forced off for it — a clock source that waits on its own
output never ticks. The launch file sets it, and ``__init__`` re-asserts it so
running the node bare is safe too.

⚠ A WORLD (RE)LOAD SENDS THE CLOCK BACKWARDS, AND THAT IS CORRECT. The engine
clock restarts with the world, so subscribers see a time jump. ROS handles this
(it is the same thing a rosbag loop does), but a node that caches timestamps
across it will see negative durations. The node logs any rewind so it is
attributable. Note ``POST /sim/reset`` does NOT rewind ``engine_time_ms``
(PROTOCOL.md §7.39); only the supervisor counter rewinds there.
