"""Execute what `interpret` parsed, on whichever bridge is asking.

One function, `route(bridge, text, surface)`, so a bridge adopts the new
interpreter in a single line instead of reimplementing a dispatch ladder. It
returns the bridges' usual reply shape --

    {"agent": "<what to say>", "tools": [(name, status, detail[, rule]), ...]}

-- or ``None``, meaning *this was not something to execute*: hand it to the
model. Returning None rather than guessing is the whole point; the keyword
ladder it replaces had no way to abstain.

THREE HONESTY RULES, ENFORCED HERE RATHER THAN TRUSTED TO PROMPTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Say what the action RETURNED, never what it was asked to do.** Every
   reply is built from the bridge's own result dict -- `accepted`, `error`,
   `measured` -- so "Stopped" is only ever said when the bridge measured a
   stop. This mirrors the note in the mobile bridge's own stop handler: the
   regex router used to print "Stopping wheels." before anything was known.

2. **Name the slots that were dropped.** Bridges differ: a quadruped's
   `act_walk()` takes no distance. Rather than silently discarding "2
   metres", the reply says it was ignored.

3. **Never invent a referent.** AMBIGUOUS comes back as a question, not as a
   guess, and nothing is actuated.

# parser, in each bridge's `/prompt` handler: with no relay attached the
